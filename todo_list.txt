1. Fix photons pathing around black hole (Space curvature calculation)
2. Add Space curvature visualization
3. Performance improvement, both in speed and memory allocation
4. Improve launch trajectory prediction.
    Gets too imprecise when close to high gravity object or not enough.
    Think about including other bodies into prediction.
    Think about predicting movement when launching without target.
5. Improve control and/or UI
6. Variable stepping - Mode during which steps are as low as possible speed, preserving ~60 fps
